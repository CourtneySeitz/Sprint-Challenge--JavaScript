1. Describe some of the differences between `.forEach` & `.map`.

`.forEach` invokes an iteration over elements within an array without changing the elements, whereas `.map` iterates over the elements in an array, then additionally modifies the array elements and saves the newly modified array elements in a new array of the same size. From my understanding. Perhaps.

2. Name five different Types in JavaScript. A Type is something that can represent data. What is so special about Arrays?

Five Data types in Javascript are **Boolean**, **Number**, **Null**, **String**, and **Undefined**.


3. What is closure? Can you code out a quick example of a closure?

I still need to go back over closure, I have missed much this week and need to review video lesson demos, finish assignments, and study concepts more thoroughly. I wouldn't feel right just winging closure when I feel shaky on coherently expressing my understanding of the topic. :-)


4. Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword. No need to provide examples about it this time :)

See above, need to go over these to know them well enough.
